# Software Engineering Project — Year 12 (Stage 6) Software Engineering

**Time allocation:** 30 hours (suggested format: project-based over the term, milestone reviews, presentation/demonstration sessions)

---

## High-level description

This module is a capstone-style project where students apply their cumulative knowledge of software design, development, testing and project management to produce a working software product and supporting documentation. It emphasises real-world engineering practices: requirement capture, design, iterative development, testing, deployment/demonstration and reflective evaluation.

---

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this module students will be able to:

* Elicit and document clear requirements and success criteria for a defined software project.
* Produce design artefacts (architecture diagram, UML or wireframes) and justify chosen approaches.
* Implement a working software solution that demonstrates appropriate use of programming, architecture and quality practices.
* Apply testing strategies and record results; refine the product based on test outcomes and user feedback.
* Use version control and basic project management techniques (milestones, task tracking, peer review).
* Deploy or demonstrate the working system and present findings, limitations and future work.
* Produce a professional project report and reflect critically on the development process and choices made.

## Core topics & concepts

1. **Project scoping & requirements** — stakeholder/user needs, functional vs non-functional requirements, success criteria.
2. **Design & planning** — architectural choices, component diagrams, data models, wireframes and user journeys.
3. **Implementation & best practice** — coding standards, modular design, reuse, secure coding basics where relevant.
4. **Testing & quality assurance** — unit tests, integration tests (as applicable), user acceptance testing and bug tracking.
5. **Version control & collaboration** — branching, pull requests, code review and merge workflows.
6. **Deployment & demonstration** — delivering a reproducible build, deployment or live demonstration strategy.
7. **Documentation & reporting** — README, user manual / quick-start guide, technical report and maintenance notes.
8. **Ethics, privacy and safety** — considerations around data handling, user privacy and ethical design choices.
9. **Reflection & continuous improvement** — identifying limitations, planning future enhancements and maintenance.

## Project structure & milestones (suggested)

* **Week 1 — Project proposal & team formation:** submit project proposal (problem statement, proposed solution, stakeholders, initial risk assessment).
* **Week 2 — Requirements & design:** finalised requirements, success criteria, high-level architecture/UML/wireframes.
* **Week 3–6 — Iterative development:** implement core features in sprints, maintain version control and issue tracker, run tests.
* **Week 7 — Testing & refinement:** perform systematic testing, address defects, polish UI/UX and documentation.
* **Week 8 — Deployment & final deliverables:** deploy project (or prepare demonstration), submit final report and source code, prepare presentation.
* **Final week — Presentation & reflection:** project demonstration, Q\&A and submission of reflective report.

## Assessment components (example weighting)

* **Project proposal & plan (10%)** — clarity of problem, feasibility and planned approach.
* **Design artefacts (15%)** — architecture diagrams, wireframes and justification of choices.
* **Working software product (40%)** — functionality, code quality, testing and demonstration.
* **Project report & documentation (20%)** — technical report, README, user guide and test logs.
* **Presentation & reflection (15%)** — demonstration quality, oral defence and reflective analysis.

> Note: adjust weightings to match school policy and assessment hours.

## Suggested deliverables

* Project proposal (short document)
* Requirements specification and success criteria
* Architecture diagram and design artefacts (UML/wireframes)
* Source code in a version-controlled repository with commit history
* Test plan and results (unit/integration/UAT as applicable)
* Deployment artifact or demonstration instructions
* Final technical report (1000–2000 words) and a short reflection
* Presentation slides and demonstration recording (optional)

---

## Practical guidance & teacher notes

* Encourage realistic project scope: choose achievable features and emphasise Minimum Viable Product (MVP) thinking.
* Provide scaffolding: starter repos, checklists for requirements and testing templates.
* Promote collaboration and peer review; require meaningful commit histories and issue-tracking evidence.
* Use rubrics that assess both technical quality and communication/documentation.
* For solo projects, ensure equitable assessment criteria that reward depth; for group projects, include peer-assessment elements.
* Emphasise safety: if projects handle data, require privacy impact considerations and avoid storing sensitive personal data in assessments.

---

## Resources & tools

* Version control: Git and GitHub/GitLab
* Project tracking: GitHub Issues / Trello / similar
* Development tools: VS Code, language-specific toolchains
* Deployment: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku or school-hosted servers
* Testing tools: pytest/unittest, Jest/Mocha, or language-appropriate frameworks
