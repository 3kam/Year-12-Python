# Programming for the Web — Year 12 (Stage 6) Software Engineering

**Time allocation:** 30 hours (suggested format: 10 × 3-hour lessons or equivalent mix of theory + practical labs)

---

## High-level description

This module introduces students to web technologies and full‑stack thinking: how web browsers and servers communicate, how to build interactive front-ends, and the basics of back-end development and data persistence. Emphasis is on practical web development fundamentals, clean design, accessibility and deploying real web apps.

---

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this module students will be able to:

* Explain client/server architecture, HTTP request/response basics and RESTful principles.
* Build static web pages using semantic HTML and style them with CSS; create responsive layouts.
* Create interactive front-ends using JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events, form handling).
* Implement simple back-end endpoints and persist data using a database or file storage (conceptual + simple implementation).
* Connect front-end to back-end using Fetch/AJAX and handle JSON data.
* Apply basic web security and accessibility best practices and deploy a small web app to a hosting service.

## Core topics & concepts

1. **Web fundamentals** — client/server model, HTTP verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), status codes, RESTful design.
2. **HTML & accessibility** — semantic elements, forms, alt text, ARIA basics, keyboard navigation.
3. **CSS & responsive design** — box model, layout (flexbox/grid), media queries, responsive images.
4. **JavaScript basics** — variables, functions, events, DOM selection and manipulation, form validation.
5. **Asynchronous web** — Fetch API / AJAX, promises, JSON parsing and handling.
6. **Basic back-end concepts** — server frameworks (Node/Express or Python/Flask), routing, middleware, request handling.
7. **Data persistence** — simple database concepts (SQL vs NoSQL), using a small database or file storage for CRUD operations.
8. **Authentication & sessions (introductory)** — cookies vs tokens, basic login flow (conceptual + simple implementation).
9. **Deployment & hosting** — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Heroku, or similar; environment configuration and build steps.
10. **Performance, testing and debugging** — browser devtools, basic profiling, unit tests for functions/endpoints.

## Practical activities & labs

* **Static site lab:** build a multi-page website using semantic HTML and CSS (responsive layout required).
* **DOM & interactivity lab:** add form validation, dynamic content and simple animations using vanilla JS.
* **API consumer lab:** fetch data from a public API and display results (e.g., weather, GitHub users).
* **Simple backend lab:** create a small REST API with 3–4 endpoints that performs CRUD on a list of items.
* **Full-stack mini project:** build a basic full-stack app (front-end + back-end + simple persistence) and deploy it publicly.
* **Accessibility & performance checks:** audit a page with devtools and fix key accessibility issues.

## Suggested weekly breakdown (10 lessons)

1. Web fundamentals, HTTP, and planning a small web project
2. HTML structure and accessibility principles; start static pages
3. CSS fundamentals: box model, layout and responsive techniques
4. Advanced CSS: flexbox/grid and responsive refinement
5. JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation exercises
6. Asynchronous JS: Fetch API, promises and handling JSON
7. Introduction to back-end development: routes and handlers (Node/Express or Flask)
8. Data persistence and connecting front-end to back-end (AJAX CRUD)
9. Deployment, environment configuration and basic security considerations
10. Project presentations, peer review and assessment submission

## Assessment suggestions

* **Major assessment (project):** Full‑stack mini app (user interface + server + persistence) with a 1000–1500 word technical report describing architecture, APIs, deployment and testing.
* **Lab assessments:** separate graded tasks for static site, DOM interactivity, and API consumer labs.
* **Quiz/test:** short conceptual quiz on HTTP, REST, and core front-end/back-end concepts.
* **Code review:** peer or teacher code review focusing on accessibility, structure and documentation.

---

## Resources & teacher notes

* **Languages & frameworks:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla), optional backend: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask.
* **Tools:** VS Code, browser devtools, Git/GitHub, Netlify/Heroku/GitHub Pages for deployment.
* **Teaching tips:** begin with static content and progressively add interactivity and back-end features; emphasise accessibility and progressive enhancement.
* **Safety/security focus:** teach students not to expose secrets (API keys/passwords) in client code and show basic input sanitisation server-side.
